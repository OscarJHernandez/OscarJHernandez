<!--
**OscarJHernandez/OscarJHernandez** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


* Problem-solving physics PhD leveraging my quantitative and numerical skills for data science. My work employs a range of statistical and machine learning methods to generate predictions with a risk analysis.

* With a background in theoretical and computational nuclear physics, I have 5+ yearsâ€™ experience implementing algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. My technical and mathematical specialization drives my passion for data science and machine learning - collecting and analyzing data sets; understanding the data and building accurate AI models to generate predictions with attention to confidence intervals.

* I am a results-oriented researcher and communicator, producing 7 publications in < 5 years; delivering 5 talks and presenting 5+ posters at leading conferences in my field at both and international levels.
